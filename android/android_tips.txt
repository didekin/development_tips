--  ?android:

You can apply a style from the app’s theme to a widget using a theme attribute
reference. This is what you are doing when you use the
value ?android:listSeparatorTextViewStyle.

In a theme attribute reference, you tell Android’s runtime resource manager,
“Go to the app’s theme and find the attribute named
listSeparatorTextViewStyle. This attribute points to another style resource.
Put the value of that resource here.”
