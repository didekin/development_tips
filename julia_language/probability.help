PACKAGES
========

--  Random.jl (in standar library)

FUNCTIONS
=========

--  Random.seed!()  to get a reproducible sequence of random numbers.

IDIOMS
======

--  To obtain a frequency distribution from a sequence of values in a vector:
    >   vv = [1,2,1,2,3,1,2,2,3];
        counts = zeros(Int, 3);
        for score in vv
            counts[score] += 1
        end

--  To generate a random sequence of -1, +1 values:
    > rand((-1, +1), numValues)
    > rand(Bool) # sequence true, false.
