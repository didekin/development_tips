# To remove a tracked file:
- delete.
- 'git rm' to commit the physical deleting.

If the file is modified after the delete instruction, and
previus to 'git rm file', is necessary to use 'git rm -f file'.

If we do not want to remove physically a file, only not to have git
track anymore:
$ git rm --cached file

Example of removing multiple files:
$ git rm log/\*.log    // removes all files that have the .log extension
 in the log directory.

# To commit snapshots without previously adding them with 'git add':

$ git -a
$ git -a -m 'text of the commit'
