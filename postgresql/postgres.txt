--  To start/stop postgres:
    > brew services start postgresql@15
    > brew services stop postgresql@15

--  To restart postgresql@15 after an upgrade:
    > brew services restart postgresql@15
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
    >  /usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@15

--  To have psql in path, I added the following line to .zshrc
    > export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"
--  To see if postgresql is running:
    > brew services list
--  To see the postgres version after starting the service
    > postgres -V

--  To create a data base
    > createdb dyndis  {outside psql}
--  To delete a database:
    > dropdb dyndis
--  To log in psql
    > psql dbasename

--  To create a user
    > psql CREATE USER cl_dyndis WITH PASSWORD 'dyndispswd';
--  To grant privileges to a user in a database:
    > psql GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA dyndis TO cl_dyndis;

PSQL

JDBC DRIVER
===========

Note:
----
Out of the box, Java does not support unix sockets so the PostgreSQL® server must be configured
to allow TCP/IP connections. Starting with server version 8.0 TCP/IP connections are allowed from
localhost . To allow connections to other interfaces than the loopback interface, you must modify the
postgresql.conf file’s listen_addresses setting.



BREW
====

--  For compilers to find postgresql@15 you may need to set:
    > export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/lib"
    > export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/include"
