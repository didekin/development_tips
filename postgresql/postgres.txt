    This formula has created a default database cluster with:
      initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /usr/local/var/postgresql@15
    For more details, read:
      https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-initdb.html

  For compilers to find postgresql@15 you may need to set:
    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/include"

    To restart postgresql@15 after an upgrade:
      brew services restart postgresql@15
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      /usr/local/opt/postgresql@15/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgresql@15
