Statistics
---------
To get the quantiles corresponding to certain probabilities:
>quantile(pid$PWGTP, probs=c(0.5, 0.8,.9))

Regression
----------

-- To fit a regression line without intercept
>lm(y~x -1)

With intercept:
>lm(y ~ x+z,data=data.frame)

-- To get the residuals:
>model$residuals

-- To include unordered factors in a linear regression model, we define one
   level as the "reference level" and add a binary variable for each of the
   remaining levels. In this way, a factor with n levels is replaced by n-1
   binary variables. The reference level is typically selected to be the most
   frequently occurring level in the dataset.

   R uses as reference level the first one. To change to the most frequent, it
   is necessary to use 'relevel'.

-- RMSE (square root of the mean of the squared residuals):
>RMSE <- sqrt(SSE / nrow(pisaTrain))
Or:
>RMSE <- sqrt(mean(lmScore$residuals^2)).
