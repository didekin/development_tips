Statistics
---------
-- To get the quantiles corresponding to certain probabilities:
>quantile(pid$PWGTP, probs=c(0.5, 0.8,.9))

-- To select rows with a logical conditions and to avoid NA values:
>x[which(x$var2 >=9),]

-- To select the row number of the maximum value of a column:
>which.max(flutrain$ILI)

Regression
----------
-- To fit a regression line without intercept
>lm(y~x -1)
With intercept:
>lm(y ~ x+z,data=data.frame)

-- To get the residuals:
>model$residuals

-- To include unordered factors in a linear regression model, we define one
   level as the "reference level" and add a binary variable for each of the
   remaining levels. In this way, a factor with n levels is replaced by n-1
   binary variables. The reference level is typically selected to be the most
   frequently occurring level in the dataset.

   R uses as reference level the first one. To change to the most frequent, it
   is necessary to use 'relevel'.

Correlation:
-- To calculate the correlation between two variables:
>correlation <- cor(data$var1,data$var2)

Prediction:
-- To predict the value with a test set:
>predTest <- predict(lm_name_model,newdata=testdata)

RMSE root mean square error:
The square root of the mean/average of the square of all of the error.
>RMSE <- sqrt(mean(y - y_pred)Ëœ2));
